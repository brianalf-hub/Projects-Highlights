### Welcome to my projects README. My name is Brian Alfaro. Currently, I am a Visiting Assistant Professor of Biology at Eastern University in St. Davids, PA. While my expertise is in experimental plant biology, throughout my career in graduate school I was/am involved in three academic big data projects in our department. <br />

## Phenotypic variation of life‚Äêhistory traits in native, invasive, and landrace populations of *Brassica tournefortii*

### Implications of study. In this study, we first used principal components analysis (PCA) to narrow down our trait variables to six composite groups. We ran ANOVA, linear regressions, and generalized additive modeling to describe genetic and evolutionary patterns. We have shown that to have a strong understanding of agricultural, land management, and/or conservation problems of a target species, we need to begin by assessing how a certain cultivar, variety, or genotype will respond to certain local conditions.

## Environmental factors affecting annual and perennial invasive plants in the American Southwest

### Importance of study. Recent calculations of the cost of impact and management of invasive species in the United States is approximately $120 billion annually (Pimentel, Zuniga, and Morrison 2005). It is therefore critical to indentify the natural and anthropogenic environmental factors that affect their diversity and distribution. Here, I identified the most highly ranked variables and regression models to determine which is the strongest factor for annual and perennial invasive species abundance and distribution. Then, I created a spatial model in R to be able to identify hotspots of invasive plant diversity in the southwest.

## The effect of bio-climatic factors on global yield of canola oil

### Importance of study. Canola oil is an important food ingredient, and can also be used as a biofuel. By expanding this model, I can determine which climatic factors affect yield for each *Brassica* oil crop. The resulting predictive model can provide a guide that shows which regions in the world these canola species can grow and produce oil abundantly, so growers both small- and industrial-scale can plan their crops accordingly.

## Metabolic asymmetry and the global diversity of marine predators

### In this paper, we developed theory on how metabolism (warm vs. cold blooded) of marine predators and the interaction of prey with ocean conditions determine the pattern of of marine predator diversity. We also supported our mathematical models by using data from conservation and fisheries databases to map the diversity of marine predators via Bayesian approximation.
