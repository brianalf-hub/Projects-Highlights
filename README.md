# Data-science-portfolio

Welcome to my professional data science portfolio. My name is Brian Alfaro. As I am typing this text, I am still a PhD candidate at the University if New Mexico (UNM, Albuquerque), but if you are reading this a couple of months from my first addition, then I may already be holding my doctorate in plant ecological genetics. While my expertise is in experimental plant biology, throughout my career in graduate school I was/am involved in three academic big data projects in our department.

### The first project examined how the association of oceanic environments and animal physiology interact to shape global patterns of biodiversity in our oceans. For this project, I mined and cleaned the data and was in charge of geographic information system (GIS) analysis that used more than 1 million data points.

### Second to anthropogenic habitat degradation, invasive plants are a major factor for loss of global biodiversity. We used vegetation survey data collected by the U.S. Geological Survey from 1997 to 2007, and climate data from WorldClim (https://www.worldclim.org/data/worldclim21.html) to identify and predict climatic factors that affect the diversity of invasive plants in the southwestern United States.
